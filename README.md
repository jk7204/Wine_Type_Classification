# Wine_Type_Classification

Using unsupervised machine learning methods to understand the space that wines inhabit. Determine how different dimension reduction methods yield similar and different results and how dimension reduction methods interface with clustering methods

## Data

wines.csv dataset contains information of 178 of the finest wines. The first row represents the column header. 
Each row after that represents the information of one wine. There are 13 attributes that characterize each wine.

Columns represent (in order):

1) Alcohol content (in %)

2) Malic acid concentration (in g/L)

3) Ash content (in mg/L) [This is not as gross as it sounds, mostly minerals absorbed by the grapes through the soil]

4) Alkalinity of the Ash (g/L of potassium carbonate)

5) Magnesium (mg / L)

6) Total phenols (mg / L per epa method)

7) Flavonoids (mg / L)

8) Stilbenes (mg / L)

9) Proanthocyanins (mg / L)

10) Color intensity (reflecting opacity)

11) Hue (= color)

12) OD280 (Protein concentration)

13) Proline content (amino acid)
